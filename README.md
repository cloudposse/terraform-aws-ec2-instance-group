# terraform-aws-ec2-instance-group [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance-group.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance-group/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform Module for providing N general purpose EC2 hosts.

If you only need to provision a single EC2 instance, consider using the [terraform-aws-ec2-instance](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance) module instead.

**IMPORTANT** This module by-design does not provision an AutoScaling group. It was designed to provision a discrete number of instances suitable for running stateful services such as databases (e.g. Kafka, Redis, etc).


Included features:
* Automatically create a Security Group
* Option to switch EIP attachment
* CloudWatch monitoring and automatic reboot if instance hangs
* Assume Role capability

[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance-group/releases).


Note: add `${var.ssh_key_pair}` private key to the `ssh agent`.

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code.


### Simple example:

```hcl
module "instance" {
  source                      = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance-group.git?ref=master"
  namespace                   = "eg"
  stage                       = "prod"
  name                        = "app"
  ami                         = "ami-a4dc46db"
  ami_owner                   = "099720109477"
  ssh_key_pair                = var.ssh_key_pair
  instance_type               = var.instance_type
  vpc_id                      = var.vpc_id
  security_groups             = var.security_groups
  subnet                      = var.subnet
  instance_count              = 3
}
```

### Example with additional volumes and EIP

```hcl
module "kafka_instance" {
  source                      = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance-group.git?ref=master"
  namespace                   = "eg"
  stage                       = "prod"
  name                        = "app"
  ami                         = "ami-a4dc46db"
  ami_owner                   = "099720109477"
  ssh_key_pair                = var.ssh_key_pair
  vpc_id                      = var.vpc_id
  security_groups             = var.security_groups
  subnet                      = var.subnet
  associate_public_ip_address = true
  additional_ips_count        = 1
  ebs_volume_count            = 2
  allowed_ports               = [22, 80, 443]
  instance_count              = 3
}
```

### Additional complete working example with variations of how to use the module
In /examples directory

This module depends on these modules:

* [terraform-terraform-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-terraform-label)

It is necessary to run `terraform get` or `terraform init` to download this module.

Now reference the label when creating an instance (for example):

```hcl
resource "aws_ami_from_instance" "example" {
  count              = length(module.instance.*.id)
  name               = "app"
  source_instance_id = element(module.instance.*.id, count.index)
}
```
