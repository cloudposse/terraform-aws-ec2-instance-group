# terraform-aws-ec2-instance-group [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance-group.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance-group) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance-group.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance-group/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform Module for providing N general purpose EC2 hosts.

If you only need to provision a single EC2 instance, consider using the [terraform-aws-ec2-instance](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance) module instead.

**IMPORTANT** This module by-design does not provision an AutoScaling group. It was designed to provision a discrete number of instances suitable for running stateful services such as databases (E.g. Kafka, Redis, etc). 


Included features:
* Automatically create a Security Group
* Option to switch EIP attachment
* CloudWatch monitoring and automatic reboot if instance hangs
* Assume Role capability

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).










## Usage

Note: add `${var.ssh_key_pair}` private key to the `ssh agent`.

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code.


### Simple example:

```hcl
module "instance" {
  source                      = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance-group.git?ref=master"
  namespace                   = "cp"
  stage                       = "prod"
  name                        = "app"
  ami                         = "ami-a4dc46db"
  ssh_key_pair                = "${var.ssh_key_pair}"
  instance_type               = "${var.instance_type}"
  vpc_id                      = "${var.vpc_id}"
  security_groups             = ["${var.security_groups}"]
  subnet                      = "${var.subnet}"

  instance_count              = "3"
}
```

### Example with additional volumes and EIP

```hcl
module "kafka_instance" {
  source                      = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance-group.git?ref=master"
  namespace                   = "cp"
  stage                       = "prod"
  name                        = "app"
  ami                         = "ami-a4dc46db"
  ssh_key_pair                = "${var.ssh_key_pair}"
  vpc_id                      = "${var.vpc_id}"
  security_groups             = ["${var.security_groups}"]
  subnet                      = "${var.subnet}"
  associate_public_ip_address = "true"
  additional_ips_count        = "1"
  ebs_volume_count            = "2"
  allowed_ports               = ["22", "80", "443"]

  instance_count              = "3"
}
```

### Additional complete working example with variations of how to use the module
In /examples directory

This module depends on these modules:

* [terraform-terraform-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-terraform-label)

It is necessary to run `terraform get` or `terraform init` to download this module.

Now reference the label when creating an instance (for example):
```hcl
resource "aws_ami_from_instance" "example" {
  count              = "${length(module.instance.*.id)}"
  name               = "terraform-example"
  source_instance_id = "${element(module.instance.*.id, count.index)}"
}
```
